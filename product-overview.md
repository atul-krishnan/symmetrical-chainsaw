**Product**
PolicyPilot is an enterprise web platform that turns internal AI policy documents into deployable compliance training programs.

It lets teams:
- Upload policy docs (`pdf/docx/txt`)
- Auto-generate role-based learning tracks (`exec`, `builder`, `general`)
- Publish assignments and send reminders
- Track quiz completion and pass/fail
- Capture employee attestation
- Export audit evidence (CSV + signed PDF)

**Value Proposition**
Core promise: **“From AI policy docs to role-ready training in under 45 minutes.”**

Why enterprises buy it:
- **Speed:** replaces manual policy-to-training work that normally takes days/weeks.
- **Role relevance:** different content for leaders, technical builders, and general staff improves completion quality.
- **Audit readiness:** structured evidence trail for completions, attempts, attestations, and exports.
- **Risk reduction:** consistent policy communication and measurable proof of adoption.
- **Operational simplicity:** one system for policy ingestion, training rollout, and compliance reporting.
