# Outbound Messaging Pack (PolicyPilot)

## Who to target (roles and signals)

### Titles

- CISO, Head of Security, Security Engineering Director
- GRC Lead, Security Compliance, Risk & Compliance, Privacy Program Manager
- People Ops / L&D (as co-owner), HR Ops (especially in regulated teams)

### High-intent triggers

- New/updated AI usage policy, data handling policy, SDLC policy, access control policy
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / customer security reviews (sales cycle friction)
- Policy incident or audit finding tied to workforce behavior
- Growth stage: hiring first GRC lead or scaling security program

## What we offer (pilot-friendly)

- 6-week paid pilot: 1-3 policy sources -> role tracks -> assignments -> nudges -> completion + attestation -> evidence exports.
- Success metrics: completion rate + attestation rate.
- "Proof" deliverables: audit CSV + checksum-signed PDF evidence summary.

## Sequence 1: CISO / Head of Security (4 emails)

### Email 1: Policy -> training -> evidence (short)

Subject: AI policy rollout without the LMS project

Hi {{first_name}},

Most teams have an AI usage policy but not a reliable way to turn it into role-specific training + audit-ready evidence.

PolicyPilot converts your policy docs into `exec`, `builder`, and `general` tracks, publishes assignments, nudges completion, and generates a CSV + checksum-signed PDF evidence pack.

If you’re rolling out an AI policy (or updating one), are you the right owner to evaluate a 6-week pilot?

### Email 2: The operational pain (follow-up)

Subject: Where the time gets lost

Hi {{first_name}},

The pattern we see:

- policy gets approved
- training takes weeks to author and review
- rollout happens without consistent completion/attestation tracking
- evidence ends up as ad-hoc spreadsheets

PolicyPilot is built to compress that into one workflow and report completion + attestation as your primary KPIs.

Worth a 20-minute walkthrough this week?

{{sender_name}}

### Email 3: Coexistence with Vanta/Drata/LMS (objection handler)

Subject: Works with your existing stack

Hi {{first_name}},

If you already use a compliance platform (or an LMS), PolicyPilot isn’t trying to replace it.

We sit in the gap between "policy PDF" and "provable workforce adoption" with role tracks, campaign ops, and evidence exports your audit stakeholders can verify.

If I send a one-page pilot outline, who should I loop in on your side (GRC, legal, L&D)?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 4: Break-up

Subject: Close the loop?

Hi {{first_name}},

Should I close this out, or is there someone responsible for AI policy training + attestation in your org?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

## Sequence 2: GRC / Compliance Lead (4 emails)

### Email 1: Evidence-first framing

Subject: Evidence pack for AI policy training

Hi {{first_name}},

When an AI policy changes, training and evidence often lag. PolicyPilot generates role-specific modules from your policy source and produces an evidence pack (CSV + checksum-signed PDF summary) for audits and customer assurance requests.

Is AI policy training and attestation in your scope?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 2: "What evidence do you get?"

Subject: What you can hand to legal/auditors

Hi {{first_name}},

PolicyPilot records:

- assignment states (not started / in progress / completed)
- quiz attempts + pass/fail outcomes
- campaign attestation per learner
- export bundles with verification metadata

If you’re open to it, I can share a sample evidence export and the pilot gates we use (completion + attestation targets).

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 3: Review flow (legal-friendly)

Subject: Human review before publish

Hi {{first_name}},

We expect legal/security to review drafts before publish. The workflow is: upload policy -> generate draft modules/quizzes -> review/edit -> publish -> nudge -> export evidence.

If you’d like, I can walk you through the review checkpoints that keep policy intent intact.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 4: Break-up

Subject: Wrong owner?

Hi {{first_name}},

If you’re not the right owner for AI policy training + evidence, who is?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

## Sequence 3: People Ops / L&D (4 emails)

### Email 1: Reduce authoring load

Subject: Less authoring, faster launch (AI policy training)

Hi {{first_name}},

PolicyPilot is designed for lean L&D teams supporting compliance rollouts. It turns policy docs into role-based modules/quizzes, then runs assignments + reminders and tracks completion + attestation.

Do you partner with Security/GRC on policy training programs?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 2: Less manual chasing

Subject: Nudges and at-risk lists built in

Hi {{first_name}},

Instead of chasing completions manually, PolicyPilot ships with:

- assignment inbox for learners
- automated nudges
- dashboards for at-risk / overdue learners
- exports for audit evidence

If you want, I can share what a typical 6-week pilot rollout looks like.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 3: Role tracks (why learners care)

Subject: Role-relevant modules (exec vs builder vs general)

Hi {{first_name}},

One thing we’ve learned: completion improves when the content matches the role. PolicyPilot generates separate tracks for executives, builders, and general staff from the same policy source.

If this is relevant, who should join a first call from Security/GRC?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

### Email 4: Break-up

Subject: Should I close this out?

Hi {{first_name}},

Should I close this out, or can you point me to the person who owns AI policy training rollout?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

## LinkedIn DM script (3 touches)

### Touch 1: Connect request (300 chars-ish)

Hi {{first_name}} - quick question: when your AI usage policy updates, how do you ship role-specific training + collect audit evidence (completion + attestation)? I’m building PolicyPilot for this exact workflow.

### Touch 2: After accept

Thanks {{first_name}}. PolicyPilot turns policy docs into exec/builder/general tracks, publishes assignments, nudges completion, and generates a CSV + checksum-signed PDF evidence pack. If AI policy rollout is on your roadmap, open to a 15-20 min walkthrough?

### Touch 3: Close the loop

If now’s not the time, who’s the best owner for AI policy training + attestation in your org?

## Qualification questions (first call)

1. What policy sources are in scope (AI usage, data handling, SDLC, access control)?
2. What’s the next "must prove" moment: audit, customer review, board ask, incident follow-up?
3. How do you currently deliver training (LMS, awareness platform, ad-hoc)?
4. What completion/attestation targets would define success in 6 weeks?
5. Who must approve content: Legal, Security, Privacy, HR?
